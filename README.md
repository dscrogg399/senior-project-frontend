This repo is from my senior design project.  It is a smart home simulation web app. 
We were required to make a smart home web app with simulated data from a backend. The DB server for this project belongs to UAB and is firewalled. 

I built this front end entirely from stubbed out dummy data after designing the end points for our backend. 
It is entirely my own work, the rest of my team has been focused on the backend.

The finished version of the project will be inaccessible since I do not own the servers, so I just felt like pushing the dummy data version because
I think it looks nice.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
